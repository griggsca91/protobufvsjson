# protobufvsjson

## Introduction

Simple comparison of sending and receiving JSON and Protobuf.  Goal was to do a simple test to see if there was a clear and distinct winner in performance for sending data as well as decoding and encoding.

## To Run Locally

In one terminal 
```sh
go run . server
```

In another terminal
```sh
sh testing/load_test.sh 20
```

## To Do

Launch this up on a DO server and run go-wrk on it 


## Current Findings when running locally
While not a good test where the load testing environment is the same as the environment being tested, it's at least a consistent environment to compare against each other
